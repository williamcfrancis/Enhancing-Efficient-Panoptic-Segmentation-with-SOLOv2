# Improved-Efficient-Panoptic-Segmentation

##Panoptic Segmentation
Panoptic segmentation is a scene understanding problem that combines the prediction from both instance and semantic segmentation into a general unified output
Our proposed project implements and modifies the state-of-the-art EfficientPS model by changing the instance segmentation head from Mask-RCNN to SOLOv2
